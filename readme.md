A program to generate maps from codes in the same way as Virtual Hydlide, made in an effort to help find better codes for speedrunning. 

The program needs to be run in a directory with the base maps in a `basemaps` folder. The base maps are the `GR_BASE<n>.BIN` files found in the `HYDLIDE\MAP01` directory on your Virtual Hydlide CD. 

Currently the main function is just a simple test timing the generation of 1 million maps, without doing anything else with them.
